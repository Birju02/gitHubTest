<h3>History</h3>
The Port Arthur penal settlement began life as a small timber station in 1830 and quickly grew in importance within the colonies. 
Ship building was introduced on a large scale to Port Arthur as a way of providing selected convicts with a useful skill they could take with them once freed.




Port Arthur is arguably one of the most beautiful destinations because of its geographic position. It has many lookouts and distinguished land features 
such as the eagle hawk neck, which is very tight road leading into port Arthur. We also be visiting the Tasman Peninsula and Storm bay, all in close vicinity of Port Arthur.

Mount Wellington: Stroll through cool forested gullies along historic walking tracks or traverse Wellington Range in the saddle on horse or mountain bike.
 Four wheel drive along rough mountain trails, climb leaning dolerite towers, or sit quietly among the birds. Find the perfect place for a picnic or to flip a burger.

Tasman Bridge: The Tasman Bridge is a five-lane bridge which crosses the Derwent River, near the central business district of Hobart, Tasmania. The bridge replaced a 1943 
floating concrete bridge which had a liftable middle section to allow ships to pass through.
