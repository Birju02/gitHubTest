<h3>History</h3>
   	
   	The 70,000 population of Launceston makes one of the highest populated cities north of Tasmania. It is located at the junction of the West and East Tamar, Tasman, and Midland highways, it is
 the headquarters of the state railway system. Launceston was first discovered in 1798 but was populated well before that. As we travel through Tasmania, it will become 
  noticeable that there are more colonial ties present in the north, than the south. There is more colonial and Georgian architecture 
	and roads built with Victorian gardens, however, many generations prior to their arrival, there were the Palawa tribesmen which were the aborigines of that land. Other tribes known 
   throughout that region include the Leterremairrener, Panninher and Tyerrernotepanner peoples.
