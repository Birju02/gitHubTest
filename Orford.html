From Launceston head south east on the national highway for 70 km. In this time, 
we will pass scenic routes, cliffs, mountain ranges and also water falls. Turning left on to Lake Leak highway 
and then in 50km turning left again on the Tasman highway we stop at Freycinet national park by turning left into
