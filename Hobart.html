<h3>History</h3>
Tasmania’s history trail begins in Hobart, the capital and economic centre of the state. To overcome the problem of overcrowding in British prisons, the British Government chose 
Australia 
as the location for a new penal colony. The southernmost island of Tasmania (known as Van Diemen’s Land at the time) was chosen for geographic reasons,
 but also because the British wanted to establish their authority over the island and prevent French invasion.	
   
  

   <h3>Local Attractions</h3>
   	<p></p>
   	<p></p>
Mount Wellington: Stroll through cool forested gullies along historic walking tracks or traverse Wellington Range in the saddle on horse or mountain bike.
 Four wheel drive along rough mountain trails, climb leaning dolerite towers, or sit quietly among the birds. Find the perfect place for a picnic or to flip a burger.

	Salamanca Markets: Tasmania’s own market is a selection of your favorite Salamanca Market stallholders and is running each Saturday from 8.30 am to 3 pm. Our new look
 market consists of over 220 stallholders representing artisans, designers and producers - it’s as Tasmanian as we can make it.

<p></p>
Tasman Bridge: The Tasman Bridge is a five-lane bridge which crosses the Derwent River, near the central business district of Hobart, Tasmania. The bridge replaced a 1943 
floating concrete bridge which had a liftable middle section to allow ships to pass through.
